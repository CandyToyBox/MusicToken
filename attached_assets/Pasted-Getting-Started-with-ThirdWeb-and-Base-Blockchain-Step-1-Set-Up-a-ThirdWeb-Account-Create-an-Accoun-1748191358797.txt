Getting Started with ThirdWeb and Base Blockchain
Step 1: Set Up a ThirdWeb Account
Create an Account:

Visit ThirdWeb's website and sign up for an account
You'll need to connect a wallet (like MetaMask) during this process
Create a New Project:

From your dashboard, create a new project
Give it a name like "Onchain Music Platform"
This will generate a Client ID for your application
Set Up Vault Wallet:

In your ThirdWeb dashboard, navigate to "Wallets" section
Create a new "Vault Wallet" - this is a secure way to manage private keys
This will generate a Vault Admin Key and Vault Access Token
Step 2: Configure the Base Sepolia Testnet
Add Base Sepolia to Your Wallet:

Open MetaMask or your preferred wallet
Add the Base Sepolia network:
Network Name: Base Sepolia Testnet
RPC URL: https://sepolia.base.org
Chain ID: 84532
Currency Symbol: ETH
Get Test ETH:

You'll need test ETH to deploy contracts and make transactions
Visit the Base Sepolia Faucet
Enter your wallet address to receive test ETH
Step 3: Add ThirdWeb Credentials to Your Application
Set Environment Variables:

Add the following environment variables to your application:
THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
THIRDWEB_VAULT_TOKEN=your_vault_access_token_here
These values come from your ThirdWeb dashboard
Restart Your Application:

Once the environment variables are set, restart your application
The application will automatically detect the credentials and switch to real blockchain mode
Step 4: Test Contract Deployment
Upload a Song:

Use your application to upload a song
Fill in all the required metadata and token information
Deploy the Token:

Navigate to the song detail page
Click the "Deploy to Blockchain" button
Wait for the deployment to complete
The console logs will show real blockchain interactions
Verify Deployment:

After deployment, your song will show a token address
You can visit Base Sepolia Explorer and paste the token address to view your contract on-chain
Step 5: Test On-Chain Play Recording
Play a Song:

Use the audio player to play a song that has been deployed
The play will be recorded on the blockchain
A transaction hash will be generated
Verify Play Recording:

The play count will increase in the UI
The transaction will be visible in the "Blockchain Transactions" section
You can click on the transaction hash to view it on BaseScan
Step 6: Monitor Your Contracts
ThirdWeb Dashboard:

Visit your ThirdWeb dashboard
Navigate to the "Contracts" section
You'll see all your deployed contracts
Base Blockchain Explorer:

Use Base Sepolia Explorer to view detailed transaction information
You can monitor gas usage, transaction status, and contract interactions
Best Practices for Production
Gas Management:

Implement proper gas estimation before transactions
Set appropriate gas limits to avoid transaction failures
Error Handling:

Add robust error handling for blockchain transactions
Implement retry mechanisms for failed transactions
Moving to Mainnet:

When ready for production, switch from Base Sepolia to Base Mainnet
Update the chain configuration in the ThirdWeb client
Ensure you have real ETH for transaction fees
By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Onchain Music platform that creates real tokens and records actual blockchain data for song plays. This provides transparency and verifiability for artists and listeners alike.
